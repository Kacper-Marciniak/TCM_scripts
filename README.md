# Broach teeth detection, classification & segmentation, supervized learning 
> Machine vision development software utilized for inspection of the broach teeth. It presents 2 step inference.
> Images captured by the camera are extracted from the background by 1st model, 2nd one is responsible for failures segmentation. 
> Result are displayed in dedicated the application.
